The employee's #427 workplace.
----------------------------

This is fun project for the game "The Stanley Parable".

The back story:

*Your name is Stanley, and you are employee #427 in some enormous corporate conglomerate of unknown name and origin, that seems to control most aspects of your life. Your job is the push the buttons that your monitor tells you to, and youâ€™ve never had any qualms or complaints about it.*
